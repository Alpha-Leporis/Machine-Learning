# Exploratory data analysis 

1. Univariate Analysis : Univariate analysis is the simplest of the three analyses where the data you are analyzing is only one variable.
Common visual technique used for univariate analysis is a histogram, which is a frequency distribution graph.

2. Bivariate Analysis : Bivariate analysis is where you are comparing two variables to study their relationships.
These variables could be dependent or independent to each other.
In Bivariate analysis is that there is always a Y-value for each X-value.
The most common visual technique for bivariate analysis is a scatter plot, where one variable is on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis.

3. Multivariate Analysis : Multivariate analysis is similar to Bivariate analysis but you are comparing more than two variables.
For three variables, you can create a 3-D model to study the relationship (also known as Trivariate Analysis).
In terms of visualization, Seaborn library in Python allows for pairplots where it generates one large chart of selected variables against one another in a series of scatter plots and histograms depending on the type of variable, also known as scatter plot matrix.
